# Postgres-X2
Postgres-X2 is an open source project to provide horizontal scalability including write-scalability,
synchronous multi-master, and transparent PostgreSQL interface. It is a collection of tightly
coupled database components which can be installed in more than one hardware or virtual
machines.

* **About the name**

This project used the name *Postgres-XC* originally, it is renamed to **Postges-X2** from 2015 after it was moved to Github. In many of the documents and code, we still use Postgres-XC.

# Project information
Please refer to the [Charter](http://postgres-x2.github.io/charter.html) for the project information



#License
This project uses the same license as PostgreSQL, [PostgreSQL license](http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/) (like BSD).

#What is Postgres-X2
* **Share nothing Cluster** :Multiple collaborating PostgreSQL-like servers, No resources shared, Scaling by adding commodity hardware
* **Write scalable PostgreSQL cluster** : More than 3× scalability performance speedup with five servers, compared with pure PostgreSQL (DBT‐1). Result as of 1.0 release. 
* **Synchronous multi‐master configuration** : Any update to any master is visible from other masters immediately.
* **Table location transparent** : Can continue to use the same applications. No change in transaction handling.
* **Based upon PostgreSQL** :Same API to Apps as PostgreSQL

* **Before you start**

Before you start to configure Postgres-XC cluster, you need to determine several things and make hardware/software ready.

**Components**

Postgres-XC database cluster consists of the following components:

*gtm*

gtm stands for "global transaction manager", which provides core of transaction management feature needed to run all the Postgres-XC component in a integrated way. Coordinators and datanodes connect to GTM to run transactions consisitently at different servers.

*gtm_proxy*

This is a proxy of a connection form coordinators/datanodes to GTM to reduce the amount of interaction and data.

*coordinator*
This is a connection point to Postgres-XC applications. A coordinator accepts SQL statements from applications, analyze and determines where the data is stored and handles SQL statements to each datanode. You can configure as many coordinators in Postgres-XC.

*datanode*

This node stores user data Datanode reads its local SQL statements from coordinators and handle them.

**How many servers you need?**

If you are just testing Postgres-XC, you need only one server. This can even be a virtual machine. You can run sufficient component on this machine but it's not a good idea to run slave of each components. pgxc_ctl will provide configuration file template but it is not suitable for this purpose. You may have to rewrite many of the template to fit to your single-server configuration.

If you are deploying Postgres-XC for more serious use, you should consider how many servers you need to store your data. You may want to run GTM at a separate server mainly for availability purpose and you may want another server to run GTM slave for hight availability.It is highly advised to install gtm_proxy, coordinator and datanode at the rest of the servers. This simplifies the configuration and maintains worload of each servers nearly even.

* **Quick Start**

The following is a quick example to setup one coordinator, two data nodes and one GTM
 
<pre><code>
 Init gtm, datanode, coordinator
  >initgtm -Z gtm -D gtm
  >initdb -D datanode1 --nodename dn1 #Initialize Datanode 1
  >initdb -D datanode2 --nodename dn2 #Initialize Datanode 2
  >initdb -D coord1 --nodename co1 # Initialize Coordinator 1

  Change configuration
  *Show and check gtm.conf and each postgresql.conf, change port values for Datanodes => 15432 for Dn1, 15433 for Dn2

  Node start-up
  >gtm -D gtm &
  >postgres -X -D datanode1 -i & # -X for a Datanode
  >postgres -X -D datanode2 -i & # -X for a Datanode
  >postgres -C -D coord1 -i & # -C for a Coordinator

  connect to coordinator
  >psql postgres

  launch that to set up cluster:
  >CREATE NODE dn1 WITH (TYPE='datanode', PORT=15432);
  >CREATE NODE dn2 WITH (TYPE='datanode', PORT=15433);
  >select * from pgxc_node;
  >select pgxc_pool_reload();

  Then you can connect to Coordinator 1 and test your newly-made cluster
